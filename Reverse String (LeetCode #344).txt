Problem 3: Reverse String (LeetCode #344)
Difficulty: Easy
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/
Problem Statement
Reverse a character array in-place.
Example:
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
Solution
javaclass Solution {
    public void reverseString(char[] s) {
        reverse(s, 0, s.length - 1);
    }
    
    private void reverse(char[] s, int left, int right) {
        if (left >= right) return;
        
        // Swap
        char temp = s[left];
        s[left] = s[right];
        s[right] = temp;
        
        // Recursive call
        reverse(s, left + 1, right - 1);
    }
}
Explanation:

Two pointers: left and right
Swap characters at both ends
Move pointers inward
Base case: pointers meet

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n) - call stack
