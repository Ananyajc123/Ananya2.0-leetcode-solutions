Problem 8: Split a String in Balanced Strings (LeetCode #1221)
Difficulty: Easy
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/split-a-string-in-balanced-strings/
Problem Statement
Given a balanced string s with equal 'L' and 'R', split it into maximum balanced substrings.
Example:
Input: s = "RLRRLLRLRL"
Output: 4
Explanation: Can be split into "RL", "RRLL", "RL", "RL"
Solution
javaclass Solution {
    public int balancedStringSplit(String s) {
        int balance = 0;
        int count = 0;
        
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (ch == 'R') {
                balance++;
            } else {
                balance--;
            }
            
            if (balance == 0) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
Explanation
Greedy Approach:

Use balance counter: R adds +1, L adds -1
When balance = 0 → equal R's and L's → balanced substring found
Split immediately (greedy) for maximum count

Visual trace for "RLRRLLRLRL":
R → balance=1
L → balance=0 → count=1 (found "RL")
R → balance=1
R → balance=2
L → balance=1
L → balance=0 → count=2 (found "RRLL")
R → balance=1
L → balance=0 → count=3 (found "RL")
R → balance=1
L → balance=0 → count=4 (found "RL")
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
