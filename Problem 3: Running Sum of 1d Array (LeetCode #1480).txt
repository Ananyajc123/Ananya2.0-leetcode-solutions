Problem 3: Running Sum of 1d Array (LeetCode #1480)
Difficulty: Easy
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/running-sum-of-1d-array/
Problem Statement
Given an array nums, we define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]…nums[i]).
Return the running sum of nums.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,3,6,10]
Explanation: 
- Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4]
- Which equals: [1, 3, 6, 10]
Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
Explanation: 
- Running sum: [1, 1+1, 1+1+1, 1+1+1+1, 1+1+1+1+1]
- Which equals: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Example 3:
Input: nums = [3,1,2,10,1]
Output: [3,4,6,16,17]
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000
-10^6 <= nums[i] <= 10^6

Solution
javaclass Solution {
    public int[] runningSum(int[] nums) {
        // Start from index 1 (second element)
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            // Add current element with previous running sum
            nums[i] = nums[i] + nums[i-1];
        }
        // Return the modified array
        return nums;
    }
}
Explanation
Approach:

We iterate through the array starting from index 1 (second element)
For each position, we add the current element with the previous element
This way, each position accumulates the sum of all previous elements
We modify the original array in-place, so no extra space is needed

Step-by-step example with [1,2,3,4]:
Initial array:  [1, 2, 3, 4]

i = 1: nums[1] = nums[1] + nums[0] = 2 + 1 = 3
       Array becomes: [1, 3, 3, 4]

i = 2: nums[2] = nums[2] + nums[1] = 3 + 3 = 6
       Array becomes: [1, 3, 6, 4]

i = 3: nums[3] = nums[3] + nums[2] = 4 + 6 = 10
       Array becomes: [1, 3, 6, 10]

Final result: [1, 3, 6, 10]
Why start from i = 1?

Index 0 already has the correct value (first element stays as is)
Starting from index 1 allows us to access nums[i-1] safely

Time Complexity: O(n) - We traverse the array once, where n is the length of the array
Space Complexity: O(1) - We modify the array in-place without using extra space (the output array doesn't count toward space complexity)
Key Concepts Used:

Array traversal using for loop
Array indexing (nums[i], nums[i-1])
In-place modification of array
Understanding of array.length property
