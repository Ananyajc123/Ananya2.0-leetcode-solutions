Problem 1: Add Two Integers (LeetCode #2235)
Difficulty: Easy
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-integers/
Problem Statement
Given two integers num1 and num2, return the sum of the two integers.
Example 1:
Input: num1 = 12, num2 = 5
Output: 17
Explanation: num1 is 12, num2 is 5, and their sum is 12 + 5 = 17
Example 2:
Input: num1 = -10, num2 = 4
Output: -6
Explanation: num1 + num2 = -6
Constraints:

-100 <= num1, num2 <= 100

Solution
javaclass Solution {
    public int sum(int num1, int num2) {
        return num1 + num2;
    }
}
Explanation
Approach:

This is a straightforward problem that requires basic arithmetic operation
We simply add the two given integers using the + operator
The return keyword sends the result back to whoever called this method

Time Complexity: O(1) - Constant time, as we're performing a single addition operation
Space Complexity: O(1) - No extra space is used
Key Concepts Used:

Basic arithmetic operators in Java
Method with return type int
Parameters and return statements
