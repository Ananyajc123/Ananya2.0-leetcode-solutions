Problem 4: Power(x, n) (LeetCode #50)
Difficulty: Medium
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/powx-n/
Problem Statement
Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n.
Example:
Input: x = 2.00000, n = 10
Output: 1024.00000
Solution
javaclass Solution {
    public double myPow(double x, int n) {
        long N = n;
        if (N < 0) {
            x = 1 / x;
            N = -N;
        }
        
        return fastPow(x, N);
    }
    
    private double fastPow(double x, long n) {
        if (n == 0) return 1.0;
        
        double half = fastPow(x, n / 2);
        
        if (n % 2 == 0) {
            return half * half;
        } else {
            return half * half * x;
        }
    }
}
Explanation:

Divide and conquer approach
x^n = (x^(n/2))^2 if n is even
x^n = x × (x^(n/2))^2 if n is odd
Handle negative powers by inverting x
Much faster than naive x × x × ... × x

Time Complexity: O(log n)
Space Complexity: O(log n)
