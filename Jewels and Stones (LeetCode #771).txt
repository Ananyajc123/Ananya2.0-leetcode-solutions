Difficulty: Easy
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/jewels-and-stones/
Problem Statement
Count how many characters in stones are present in jewels.
Example:
Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: 'a' appears 1 time, 'A' appears 2 times
Solution
javaclass Solution {
    public int numJewelsInStones(String jewels, String stones) {
        int count = 0;
        
        for (char stone : stones.toCharArray()) {
            if (jewels.indexOf(stone) != -1) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
Explanation

Loop through each character in stones
Check if it exists in jewels using indexOf()
If found (indexOf returns >= 0), increment count

Time Complexity: O(n × m) where n=stones length, m=jewels length
Space Complexity: O(1)
