Problem 8: K-th Symbol in Grammar (LeetCode #779)
Difficulty: Medium
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/k-th-symbol-in-grammar/
Problem Statement
Generate rows where row 1 = "0", and each row is formed by replacing 0→01 and 1→10.
Example:
Input: n = 3, k = 3
Output: 1
Explanation:
Row 1: 0
Row 2: 01
Row 3: 0110
Solution
javaclass Solution {
    public int kthGrammar(int n, int k) {
        if (n == 1) return 0;
        
        int length = (int)Math.pow(2, n - 2);
        
        if (k <= length) {
            return kthGrammar(n - 1, k);
        } else {
            return 1 - kthGrammar(n - 1, k - length);
        }
    }
}
Explanation:

Each row has 2^(n-1) elements
First half = previous row
Second half = flipped previous row
If k in first half: same as parent
If k in second half: flip of parent

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
