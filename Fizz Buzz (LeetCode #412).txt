Problem 1: Fizz Buzz (LeetCode #412)
Difficulty: Easy
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/fizz-buzz/
Topics: Conditionals, Loops, String Manipulation
Problem Statement
Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:

answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5
answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3
answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5
answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true

Example 1:
Input: n = 3
Output: ["1","2","Fizz"]
Example 2:
Input: n = 5
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz"]
Example 3:
Input: n = 15
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz","Fizz","7","8","Fizz","Buzz","11","Fizz","13","14","FizzBuzz"]
Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^4


Solution
javaimport java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class Solution {
    public List<String> fizzBuzz(int n) {
        // Create result list to store answers
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // Loop from 1 to n (inclusive)
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            // Check divisibility by both 3 and 5 first
            if (i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0) {
                result.add("FizzBuzz");
            } 
            // Check divisibility by 3
            else if (i % 3 == 0) {
                result.add("Fizz");
            } 
            // Check divisibility by 5
            else if (i % 5 == 0) {
                result.add("Buzz");
            } 
            // Not divisible by 3 or 5
            else {
                result.add(String.valueOf(i));
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}

Explanation
Approach:

Create an ArrayList to store the results
Iterate from 1 to n using a for loop
For each number, check conditions in order:

First check: divisible by both 3 AND 5 (i % 15 == 0 also works)
Second check: divisible by 3 only
Third check: divisible by 5 only
Else: convert number to string and add it


Return the result list

Why check both 3 and 5 first?

If we check only 3 first, number 15 would be added as "Fizz" and we'd never reach the FizzBuzz condition
Order matters in if-else-if chains!

Key Concepts:

Modulo operator (%): Returns remainder of division

15 % 3 == 0 → 15 is divisible by 3
15 % 5 == 0 → 15 is divisible by 5


ArrayList: Dynamic array that can grow in size
String.valueOf(): Converts integer to string

Dry Run (n = 5):
i = 1: Not divisible by 3 or 5 → Add "1"
i = 2: Not divisible by 3 or 5 → Add "2"
i = 3: Divisible by 3 → Add "Fizz"
i = 4: Not divisible by 3 or 5 → Add "4"
i = 5: Divisible by 5 → Add "Buzz"

Result: ["1", "2", "Fizz", "4", "Buzz"]
Time Complexity: O(n) - We iterate through n numbers once
Space Complexity: O(1) - Excluding the output array, we only use constant extra space
Alternative Solution (String Concatenation):
javaclass Solution {
    public List<String> fizzBuzz(int n) {
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            String current = "";
            
            if (i % 3 == 0) current += "Fizz";
            if (i % 5 == 0) current += "Buzz";
            if (current.equals("")) current = String.valueOf(i);
            
            result.add(current);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
This approach builds the string by concatenating "Fizz" and "Buzz" separately.
