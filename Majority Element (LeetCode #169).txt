Problem 6: Majority Element (LeetCode #169)
Difficulty: Easy
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/
Problem Statement
Return the majority element (appears more than ⌊n/2⌋ times).
Example:
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
Solution 1: Using Sorting (Simplest)
javaclass Solution {
    public int majorityElement(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        return nums[nums.length / 2];
    }
}
Explanation:

Majority element appears > n/2 times
After sorting, it MUST be at middle position

Time Complexity: O(n log n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
Solution 2: Boyer-Moore Voting (Best)
javaclass Solution {
    public int majorityElement(int[] nums) {
        int candidate = 0;
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (count == 0) {
                candidate = num;
            }
            count += (num == candidate) ? 1 : -1;
        }
        
        return candidate;
    }
}
Explanation:

Maintain candidate and count
If count becomes 0, change candidate
Majority element survives cancellation

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
