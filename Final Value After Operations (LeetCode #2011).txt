Problem 7: Final Value After Operations (LeetCode #2011)
Difficulty: Easy
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/final-value-of-variable-after-performing-operations/
Problem Statement
Given operations array where each operation is "++X", "X++", "--X", or "X--", return final value starting from X=0.
Example:
Input: operations = ["--X","X++","X++"]
Output: 1
Explanation: X = 0 → -1 → 0 → 1
Solution 1 (Using contains)
javaclass Solution {
    public int finalValueAfterOperations(String[] operations) {
        int X = 0;
        
        for (String op : operations) {
            if (op.contains("+")) {
                X++;
            } else {
                X--;
            }
        }
        
        return X;
    }
}
Solution 2 (Using charAt)
javaclass Solution {
    public int finalValueAfterOperations(String[] operations) {
        int X = 0;
        
        for (String op : operations) {
            if (op.charAt(1) == '+') {
                X++;
            } else {
                X--;
            }
        }
        
        return X;
    }
}
Explanation

If operation contains '+' or middle char is '+' → increment
If operation contains '-' or middle char is '-' → decrement
Both "++X" and "X++" increment X (position doesn't matter here)

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
